    "Ivan's face was pretty grim. It was pretty obvious to him that his engine was making loud noises and that wasn't a good thing! Bad timing, he thought, just when I needed a load of cash to sponsor my social media marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanic's face was telling a completely different story, though! Maybe he was happy that a lot of cash will end up in his pocket (BMW repairs were pretty expensive - everybody knew that one). He was considering only two options - completely worn out brakes and bearing failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ivan asked with a trembling voice: \"Zdravko, what is it and how much to repair? Save me, brother!\". Zdravko smiled and said nothing. His wrench was close by, so he took it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was happening in Zdravko's head you might ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "95% of the engines that has bearing failure have the same loud noise as that of Ivan's car. So the probability of hearing knocking noises from your engine given that your car has bearing failure is 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "But you don't want to know what is the probability of hearing those sounds! **You want to know what is the probability of having bearing failure!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Zdravko knew that 70% of the cars with completely work out breaks make the same exact noise. Zdravko combined the possible causes implied by the noise with his prior experience and got the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanic has been working with cars for more than 15 years and has a vast experience of similar cases. Using his knowlege he estimated that the probability of having the noise given that the car has bearing failure is 95%. Which can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{1} p(\\text{engine noise}\\,|\\,\\text{bearing failure})=0.95$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, he estimated the probability of having the noise given that the brakes are worn out as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{2} p(\\text{engine noise}\\,|\\,\\text{worn out brakes})=0.7$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations show us the **likelihood** of the car having bearing failure or worn out brakes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now was the time to use Zdravko's vast experience. He estimated that a random car has around 1% of having a bearing failure. Which can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{3} p(\\text{bearing failure})=0.01$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents Zdravko's prior knowledge (or prior probability) about bearing failure before even seeing the car itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zdravko is no fool! He knew that he has to combine some of the numbers somehow. One last thing: he estimated that every 80 out of 1000 (or 0.08) cars have engine noises.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now the tricky part (this might require a leap of faith) - Zdravko knew about the Bayes Rule! Furthermore, he knew how to apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{4} p(\\text{bearing failure}\\,|\\,\\text{engine noise}) = \\frac{p(\\text{engine noise}\\,|\\,\\text{bearing failure}) \\, p(\\text{bearing failure})}{p(\\text{random car has engine noise})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Zdravko calculated the probability of having a bearing failure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{5} p(\\text{bearing failure}\\,|\\,\\text{engine noise}) = (0.95 \\times 0.01)\\,/\\,0.08 = 0.11875 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or below 12% - this is called **posterior probability**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now 12% sounds like unlikely event but Zdravko had to compare it against the other option - worn out brakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "He estimated that the probability of worn out brakes is 10%. Which can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{6} p(\\text{worn out brakes})=0.1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the probability of having worn out brakes given the engine noise is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag{5} p(\\text{worn out brakes}\\,|\\,\\text{engine noise}) = (0.7 \\times 0.1)\\,/\\,0.08 = 0.875 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or roughly 88% (Forgive Zdravko his rounding errors, he is doing this in his head). Note that the probabilities sum up almost to 1 (Coincidence? See below), so Zdravko was doing good."

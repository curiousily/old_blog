    "A famous result Ivan heard about is the Law of Large Numbers. Simply put the law states that if you repeat a random experiment, many, many, many times, your outcomes should on average be equal to the theoretical average.\n",

But your estimate might be 50 heads and 50 tails since you believe that the coin is fair (What if you get 100 heads and 0 tails?). The law of large numbers tells us that the more samples we take (i.e. more times we throw the coin) the more accurate our result will be.\n",
